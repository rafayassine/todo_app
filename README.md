# Todo App

This is a simple Todo App where the user can log in,
create,edit or delete Tasks ,view them and complete them.
Only the users logged in can create, delete or edit tasks.
This app is written using Rails, Html and Sass.

Some of the gems I used :
* devise
* pg
* rails12factor
* simple_form
